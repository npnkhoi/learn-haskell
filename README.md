# Haskell Learning
This repo contains my notes when learning Haskell, required and inspired by CS308 course at Fulbright University Vietnam. In the course, this is called the Programming Language Project (or PLP), where each student picks a entirely new language and learn it from scratch.

The list of notes below introduces you to the elements of Haskell language. I assume you know at least one programming language, and you only need a bit introduction to adapt to a new language like Haskell.

In each note, I do attach a link to working code files (`.hs`) so that you can download and run them. Because the code contains Haskell definitions, you may have to load them and call a particular function.
