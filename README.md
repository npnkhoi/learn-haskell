# Haskell Learning
This repo contains my notes when learning Haskell, required and inspired by CS308 course at Fulbright University Vietnam. In the course, this is called the Programming Language Project (or PLP), where each student pick a entirely new language to them and learn from scratch.

## Note list
1. [PLP1 - History and Hello World](PLP1%20-%20History%20and%20Hello%20World.md)
2. [PLP2 - Names, Types and Binding](PLP2%20-%20Names%2C%20Types%20and%20Binding.md)
