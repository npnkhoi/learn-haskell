# Subroutines and Loops

## Functions
- first class
- weird parameters

## Loops
A loop in itself is imperative and is likely to have side effects. Due to its functional nature, Haskell does not have explicit loops like typical imperative languages like Python and C++. However, it certainly support ways to repeat operations.

The first way is to have recursive functions that have a counter parameter.

The second way is to use list comprehension.
